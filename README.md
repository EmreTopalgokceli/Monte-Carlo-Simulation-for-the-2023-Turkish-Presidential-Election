# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-the-2023-Turkish-Presidential-Election

**Overview**

This project uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the chances of each of the four presidential candidates winning the 2023 Turkish Presidential Election. The simulation is based on opinion polling data collected for each candidate, and ran 10,000 simulations to calculate the chances of each candidate winning.

Please note that this is just a fun project, and the results are not meant to be taken as a serious prediction of the election outcome. As I all know, election polls can be biased and unpredictable!

**Data**

The data used for this simulation is sourced from Opinion polling for the 2023 Turkish presidential election page on Wikipedia. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2023_Turkish_presidential_election)

**Running the Simulation**

The simulation is written in Python and uses the NumPy library for random number generation. You can find the code used for this simulation in the simulation.py file.

To run the simulation, simply run the simulation.py file in a Python environment. The simulation will generate a plot showing the winning probabilities for each candidate by day.

**Results**

The simulation results show that one candidate has the highest chance of winning the election, with a probability of 60%. However, as mentioned earlier, this is just a fun project and the actual outcome of the election may be different!

**Conclusion**

I hope you find this Monte Carlo simulation for the 2023 Turkish Presidential Election to be an interesting and fun project. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for checking out my project!
